# Session 04: Autoscaling With HPA And VPA

This session explains Kubernetes application autoscaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler.

The main teaching idea is:

```text
HPA changes how many Pods run.
VPA changes, or recommends, how much CPU and memory each Pod requests.
Cluster autoscaling changes how many Nodes exist.
```

This session focuses on HPA and VPA. Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter, and EKS Auto Mode node scaling are related topics, but they are not the main lab here.

## Autoscaling Layers

```text
Incoming traffic or workload
  -> HPA decides replica count
    -> Deployment creates or removes Pods
      -> Scheduler places Pods on Nodes
        -> If there is not enough Node capacity, node autoscaling may add Nodes

Observed CPU and memory usage
  -> VPA calculates resource recommendations
    -> VPA may only report recommendations
    -> or VPA may apply requests when Pods are created or recreated
```

## HPA In One Line

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler watches metrics and updates the `replicas` value of a scalable resource such as a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or StatefulSet.

Example:

```text
If one Pod is too busy, run more Pods.
```

HPA is best for stateless workloads where more replicas can share traffic.

## VPA In One Line

Vertical Pod Autoscaler watches CPU and memory usage and recommends, or applies, better container resource requests.

Example:

```text
If one Pod was given too little CPU or memory, give each Pod a bigger request.
```

VPA is useful for right-sizing workloads and preventing under-requested or over-requested Pods.

## Why Resource Requests Matter

Autoscaling decisions depend heavily on `resources.requests`.

For CPU-based HPA, utilization is calculated against the requested CPU:

```text
CPU utilization percentage = current CPU usage / requested CPU
```

If a container requests `100m` CPU and currently uses `80m`, Kubernetes treats that as:

```text
80m / 100m = 80% CPU utilization
```

If the HPA target is `50%`, this Pod is above target, so HPA may add replicas.

Without CPU requests, CPU utilization based HPA cannot calculate the percentage correctly.

## HPA Formula

Kubernetes uses this basic ratio:

```text
desiredReplicas = ceil(currentReplicas * currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue)
```

Example:

```text
currentReplicas = 2
current average CPU utilization = 90%
target average CPU utilization = 50%

desiredReplicas = ceil(2 * 90 / 50)
desiredReplicas = ceil(3.6)
desiredReplicas = 4
```

The HPA controller then updates the Deployment replica count, and the Deployment creates the extra Pods.

## VPA Components

VPA is not installed by default in Kubernetes. It is installed as extra cluster components and a CRD.

The VPA system has three major parts:

- Recommender: reads historical and current usage, then writes recommendations into the VPA object status.
- Updater: decides whether existing Pods should be evicted so new Pods can get updated requests.
- Admission controller: mutates new Pods at creation time so they start with VPA-recommended requests.

## VPA Update Modes

VPA supports several update modes:

- `Off`: only generate recommendations. This is the safest mode for learning and production analysis.
- `Initial`: apply recommendations only when Pods are first created.
- `Recreate`: evict Pods when the recommendations need to be applied.
- `InPlace` and `InPlaceOrRecreate`: apply changes without eviction when supported by the cluster and VPA feature gates.

In this session, use `Off` first. Use `Recreate` only after students understand that VPA can restart Pods.

## HPA And VPA Together

Do not blindly run CPU-based HPA and CPU-managing VPA on the same Deployment.

Reason:

```text
HPA reads CPU utilization as usage divided by request.
VPA changes the CPU request.
Changing the request changes the percentage HPA sees.
```

This can create confusing scaling behavior.

Common production patterns:

- Use HPA for replica scaling and VPA in `Off` mode for recommendations.
- Use HPA on external or custom business metrics, and VPA for CPU/memory request sizing.
- Use VPA for workloads that should not scale horizontally.
- Use node autoscaling separately so the cluster can add capacity when HPA creates more Pods.

## Prerequisites

You need:

- A working Kubernetes cluster.
- `kubectl` configured for the cluster.
- Metrics Server installed and working.
- Enough node capacity for extra Pods.
- VPA installed before the VPA sub-session.

Check metrics:

```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io
```

If those commands do not work, finish `subsessions/01-prerequisites-and-namespace` before starting HPA.

## Sub-Session Order

Follow the sub-sessions in this order:

1. `subsessions/01-prerequisites-and-namespace`: verify Metrics Server and create the lab Namespace.
2. `subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling`: scale a Deployment horizontally from CPU load.
3. `subsessions/03-vpa-installation`: install or verify the VPA system components.
4. `subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations`: generate VPA recommendations and optionally apply them with `Recreate`.
5. `subsessions/05-hpa-vpa-production-patterns`: discuss when to use HPA, VPA, or both.

## Target Shape By The End

```text
HPA lab:

load-generator Deployment
  -> cpu-demo Service
    -> cpu-demo Deployment
      -> HPA watches CPU metrics
        -> HPA updates Deployment replicas

VPA lab:

vpa-load-generator Deployment
  -> vpa-demo Service
    -> vpa-demo Deployment
      -> VPA watches CPU and memory metrics
        -> VPA writes recommendations
        -> optional Recreate mode updates future Pods
```

## Full Apply Order

From `sessions/04-hpa-vpa`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f subsessions/01-prerequisites-and-namespace/
kubectl apply -f subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling/01-cpu-demo-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling/02-cpu-demo-hpa.yml
kubectl apply -f subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling/03-load-generator.yml
```

Watch HPA:

```bash
kubectl get hpa -n app-autoscaling -w
```

After the HPA lab, stop its load generator before moving to the VPA lab:

```bash
kubectl delete -f subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling/03-load-generator.yml --ignore-not-found
```

Install VPA by following:

```text
subsessions/03-vpa-installation/README.md
```

Then run the VPA lab:

```bash
kubectl apply -f subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations/01-vpa-demo-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations/02-vpa-recommendation-only.yml
kubectl apply -f subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations/04-vpa-load-generator.yml
```

Check VPA recommendations:

```bash
kubectl describe vpa vpa-demo -n app-autoscaling
```

Optional, apply recommendations by recreating Pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations/03-vpa-auto-recreate.yml
kubectl delete pod -n app-autoscaling -l app=vpa-demo
kubectl get pods -n app-autoscaling -w
```

## Cleanup

From `sessions/04-hpa-vpa`:

```bash
kubectl delete -f subsessions/04-vpa-recommendations/ --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f subsessions/02-hpa-cpu-autoscaling/ --ignore-not-found
kubectl delete -f subsessions/01-prerequisites-and-namespace/ --ignore-not-found
```

If you installed VPA only for this lab, remove it by following:

```text
subsessions/03-vpa-installation/README.md
```

Do not remove Metrics Server if other labs, dashboards, HPA, or VPA examples still need it.

## Troubleshooting

If HPA shows `<unknown>`:

```bash
kubectl top pods -n app-autoscaling
kubectl describe hpa cpu-demo -n app-autoscaling
kubectl describe pod -n app-autoscaling -l app=cpu-demo
```

Common causes:

- Metrics Server is missing or unhealthy.
- The target Pods do not have CPU requests.
- The Pods are not Ready yet.
- The workload has not produced enough metrics yet.

If VPA has no recommendation:

```bash
kubectl get vpa -n app-autoscaling
kubectl describe vpa vpa-demo -n app-autoscaling
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep vpa
kubectl top pods -n app-autoscaling
```

Common causes:

- VPA is not installed.
- Metrics Server is not installed.
- The Pods have not run long enough.
- There is too little real resource usage for the recommender to learn from.
